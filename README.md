- The concept of Pokemon games works well for a game and as a fan of the franchise it was exicting to come up with this pvp concept.

- The layout of the game uses flexbox. This game was created using VS Code, CSS, HTML and JavaScript and displayed on gitHub pages.

- Trying to get it deployed onto github for some reason. It would not show up on the platform.
- trying to structure the layout of the game. For example displaying a text box for the user to enter their name and picking their character instead of it being a random character at the start of the game.
