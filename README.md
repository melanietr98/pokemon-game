## <br><img src='https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/black-white/normal/charizard.png' style='display:inline;vertical-align:middle;'>Motivation 
- The motivation behind this was my love for the franchise and the game. I felt very inspired and the concept of Pokemon games works well for a game and as a fan of the franchise it was exicting to come up with this pvp concept. It was super exciting to see my ideas come to life especially as coding it and seeing it progress day by day.

- The layout of the game uses basic css.

Some of the problems that I faced where deploying my project onto Github pages for some reason. I was trying to commit everyday and it would not work and I ended up having to commit manually which was kind of odd. I don't know what happened but it just wouldn't work on my end. Something wasn't working with my laptop on my end. Another problem I faced was trying to structure the layout of the game. For example displaying a text box for the user to enter their name and picking their character instead of it being a random character at the start of the game. I did not want it to randomize each time. I did have a few verisions of the game and one of them you did end up picking a pokemon of your choice and the other did randomize. 

The other problem I faced was getting my ideas to translate into code. like I mentioned previously it was exicting seeing my ideas come to life but it's a bit of a challenge sometimes for me to translate those ideas onto code because I have so many big crazy ideas and don't know where to exactly to begin which was frustrating.



## <br><img src='https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/x-y/normal/mr-mime.png' style='display:inline;vertical-align:middle;'>**Code Explained**

The code defines a class called "Pokemon" which is used to create objects that represent Pokemon characters. Each Pokemon object has properties such as name, sprite (image), hp (hit points), moves (list of possible moves), and btn_styles (style for buttons). These objects are stored in an array called Pokemons.

There are also some global variables defined such as pokemon1I and pokemon2I which are indices of the two selected Pokemon characters in the Pokemons array. The gameStarted variable is used to keep track of whether the game has started or not.

The constructor method of the Pokemon class is used to set the values of the properties of a Pokemon object when it is created. The constructor takes in parameters such as name, sprite, hp, moves, and btn_styles and sets them as properties of the object.

The list of Pokemon characters is defined using the pkmList array. Each element of the array represents a Pokemon character and consists of its name, sprite, hp, and moves.

The rest of the code is defining styles and other details for buttons and images in the game.
