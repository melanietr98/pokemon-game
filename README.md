<h2 align="center">Pokemon- Go Inspired Game:</h2>  
This is a choice-based game inspired by Pokemon-Go. You will be able to select your moves which determines if you win or not.



## Motivation <img src="https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/black-white/normal/pikachu-f.png">
- The concept of Pokemon games works well for a game and as a fan of the franchise it was exicting to come up with this pvp concept.

## **Layouts** <img src="https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/black-white/normal/gyarados-f.png">
- The layout of the game uses flexbox

## **Problems Faced**<img src="https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/black-white/normal/blastoise.png">
- Trying to get it deployed onto github for some reason. It would not show up on the platform.
- trying to structure the layout of the game. For example displaying a text box for the user to enter their name and picking their character instead of it being a random character at the start of the game.




## **How To Play** <img src="https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/black-white/normal/steelix-f.png">
