- The motivation behind this was my love for the franchise and the game. I felt very inspired and the concept of Pokemon games works well for a game and as a fan of the franchise it was exicting to come up with this pvp concept. It was super exciting to see my ideas come to life especially as coding it and seeing it progress day by day.

- The layout of the game uses basic css.

Some of the problems that I faced where deploying my project onto Github pages for some reason. I was trying to commit everyday and it would not work and I ended up having to commit manually which was kind of odd. I don't know what happened but it just wouldn't work on my end. Something wasn't working with my laptop on my end. Another problem I faced was trying to structure the layout of the game. For example displaying a text box for the user to enter their name and picking their character instead of it being a random character at the start of the game. I did not want it to randomize each time. I did have a few verisions of the game and one of them you did end up picking a pokemon of your choice and the other did randomize. 

The other problem I faced was getting my ideas to translate into code. like I mentioned previously it was exicting seeing my ideas come to life but it's a bit of a challenge sometimes for me to translate those ideas onto code because I have so many big crazy ideas and don't know where to exactly to begin which was frustrating.
